# neighbourhood-map-react

This is a React-Native Redux project using Expo Client. Upon cloning it and opening it in either Android Simulator or in expo app of real device, user of this app will be prompted to either login using "Google" or "Facebook" - OAuth has been used. Upon authenticating, Google map will be opened for the user, where user can go to any place on the map and tap a place of his/her choice. After user selects a particular place on the Map, user will be asked to search either for 'Coffee-shops' or 'Multiplex' in that region. Based on user's choice 'FourSquare' api is called to list out all the restaurants in the area, where each item has the link to open 'Google Map' (<Linking> api exposed by Expo Client has been used here) to get the direction. Please note that this app is at its initial stage, many more functionalities will be added later.
